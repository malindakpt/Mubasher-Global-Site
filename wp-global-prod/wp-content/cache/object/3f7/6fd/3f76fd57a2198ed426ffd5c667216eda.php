This is in support of CFA Institute’s global initiative to advise buyers of financial services products of the conduct they are entitled to expect from financial service providers.

The declaration was signed by all three Mubasher business lines, which includes Mubasher Financial Services, MubasherTrade and Mubasher Financial Investments, underpinning the firm’s commitment to providing an ethical and best-in-class service to all of its clients.

The CFA Institute’s Statement of Investor Rights, which is central to Mubasher’s business ethos, is a list of principles intended to help investors demand the service they are entitled to expect from financial service providers. The statement includes the rights that investors are entitled to expect, such as objective advice, disclosure of conflicts of interest, and fair and reasonable fees.

The statement applies to financial products and services such as investment management, research and advice, personal banking, insurance and real estate, and is intended to help investors ensure that financial professionals abide by these rights.

Throughout the month of May, many of the 144 CFA societies worldwide held local events, and called for attention to the needs and rights of investors by endorsing the Statement of Investor Rights.

<strong>Amr Hussein Elalfy, MBA, CFA,</strong> Mubasher’s Global Head of Research and Secretary-General of CFA Society Egypt said:

“We are absolutely committed to supporting CFA Institute’s global initiative via signing the Statement of Investor Rights, which embodies key principles, which are central to our business ethics and corporate culture. As we continue our growth momentum across the region, we are focused on ensuring that our clients receive a consistent and quality level of service across all our lines of business. In support of this we will be circulating the Statement of Investor’s Rights to our clients, stakeholders and employees and look forward to supporting CFA Institute with its future initiatives.”
