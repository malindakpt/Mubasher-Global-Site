According to an analysis of the performance of companies listed on the UAE stock exchanges since 2000 by MubasherTrade and shared exclusively with Wealth Monitor, out of 30 IPOs since 2000 on the UAE bourses, 16 are trading below the issue price/offer price, while the rest 14 are trading above it (as of Feb 14, 2016).
